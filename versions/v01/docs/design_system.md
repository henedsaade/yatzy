In this game, we decided to have a simple game of Tic Tac Toe that is easy to follow, comprehensible, and easy on the eyes. I opted for a simple black and white design to make it easy to look at. For the stylistic options, I decided to implement a "hover" option so it shows who's next to play to make sure there's no errors with that. Like I mentioned prior, for simplicity sake, I opted for a simple design of the UI. For the functionality of the game, I had previous experience implementing a Tic Tac Toe game in Python, so I got inspired by that and decided to code only the winning combinations instead of all possible combinations and sift through those instead.
