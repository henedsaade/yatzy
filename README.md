I have tried to debug my code but it is not working. Currently, my game is detecting when X wins and when it's a draw but it is not working for when O wins. But my game was working in assignment 2 (as you can see in the design_system folder), I apologize for the inconvenience and I hope I can at least get partial points. Thank you.
